# finite-fluids

Current finite liquid test run, was experimenting with trying to make it flow more realistically because it struggles to flow down straight narrow paths right now. Also looks awful right now. The regular water block is not getting added to the game currently, not sure why. (Been testing with the salt water version). Once we get to a functional and visually appealing state, I will likely switch gears back to GPU compute offload for performance gains.
